# Broadcasters of Brilliance

**Broadcasting Human Excellence in the Age of AI**

This project is a working prototype of a system designed to find and elevate exceptional human (and human + AI) creativity. Built with a streamlined, integrated HTML interface, it demonstrates how AI can be used not to replace, but to *recognize* the most original, boundary-pushing creators working today.

## ?? Try the Demo
[Live Demo](https://drjackegerton.github.io/novelty-detection-demo-v7/)

Explore our novelty-detecting AI in action. It highlights unique creators from across the digital space, surfacing unsung brilliance for broader recognition.

## ?? Project Overview
[OSF Project Page](https://osf.io/xqbnd/)

This contains a summary of the underlying methodology, philosophical aims, and technical details for anyone interested in the bigger picture.

## ?? Why This Matters

The world is flooded with content. Brilliant creators are often buried beneath mediocrity and hype. Our AI filters through the noise, spotlighting work that deserves to be seen—and supporting the humans behind it.

We are **not** trying to build another social network. We are building a *signal amplifier*.

## ?? Want to Get Involved?

We’re looking for:
- **Developers** who can help scale this into a full platform
- **Funders** who believe in making cultural elevation algorithmic and equitable
- **Creatives & Supporters** who want to be part of a next-gen meritocracy
